# Database

## Provider

The API uses PostgreSQL through Prisma.

Prisma is managed from the repository root because the database schema belongs to the backend app, but the commands are run as monorepo-level maintenance tasks.

Schema location:

```text
apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma
```

Migration location:

```text
apps/api/prisma/migrations
```

## Local Configuration

Development configuration is stored in `apps/api/.env`.

The file is ignored by Git.

Expected values:

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/finance_manager?schema=public"
```

Replace the PostgreSQL user, password, host, port, or database name with your local setup.

## Commands

Generate Prisma Client:

```bash
npm run db:generate
```

Apply migrations in development:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

Open Prisma Studio:

```bash
npm run db:studio
```

Deploy existing migrations in a deployed environment:

```bash
npm run db:deploy
```

## Current Models

`User` stores registered users and their role/status.

`AccessRequest` stores visitor requests for access approval.

A partial unique index on `AccessRequest.email` prevents more than one pending request for the same normalized email. Historical approved or denied rows remain compatible with the data model.

`ApprovedEmail` stores emails approved by an admin before registration.

No financial tables exist yet.
