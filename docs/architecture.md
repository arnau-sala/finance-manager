# Architecture

## Phase 1

The repository starts as a small monorepo with a single implemented app:

```text
apps/api
```

The API owns all backend behavior. The frontend and shared packages can be added later when they are useful.

Current request flow:

```text
HTTP client -> Fastify API -> route handler
```

No database is required in Phase 1.
